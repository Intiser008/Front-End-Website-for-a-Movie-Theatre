    <h3>Design choices for CSS:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <img src="layout.png" height="600" alt="Image Not Found" />
        </li>
        <li>
            Only one stylesheet was used (references.css). This stylesheet contains the styling for the navigation menu, where the borders were added, the texts were centralized,<br />
            the font-style and colours were set, the background-color was set. The css stylesheet also has the common styling for the company name and the animation of the logo.<br />
        </li>
        <li>
            One feature that was used was the bordering of the navigation menu. Using border styling, a dotted border was given to it, with a border radius, which gave the borders<br />
            rounded edges. The border was also filled up with the colour goldenrod.
        </li>
        <li>
            Another feature that was used was the font-styles. All texts in the webpages were given a common font-style of Times New Roman, which was added to the references.css as<br />
            part of *{}.
        </li>
        <li>
            One more feature used was hovering effect of the hyperlinks. By default, the hyperlinks have a blue colour, but when hovered over, the cursor changes to a pointer, and the<br />
            text colour changes to red. The line that hyperlinks come with by default has been removed.
        </li>
        <li>
            No outside sources were used.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            In Movies page, the movies.js was used which contain a getMovies() function, containing an array of movies and their information. An object "movies" was created using the <br />
            getMovies function. Then the pbject was used to insert innerHTML in the movies page to display movie information.
        </li>
        <li>
            The videos are being created as a slideshow so that every video play on a loop within an interval of 2 seconds. This was done using a function, where the style.display is <br />
            'none' and then each video is made display.block one by one using a loop.
        </li>
        <li>
            Only the Select Cinemas drop-down list could be made, which was created by iterating over and object created from the getMovies() function.
